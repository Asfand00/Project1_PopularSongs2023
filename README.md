# Project1_PopularSongs2023
Some methods in SongManagerInferface are not used, generates warnings 

Update: in terminal run javac -Xdoclint:all -cp "src;lib/*" src/filename.java (will correct most of the errors)  

When running -Xdoclint:all -cp "src;lib/*" src/Song.java, Warnings are still generated for missing comments on the fields such as "trackName", even though comments are there in correct format (not sure how to fix this yet)

Also in IntelliJ, these comments are being recognized as "dangling comments" (not sure how to fix this yet either)
